# Dice Roll Challenge

Our dice roll application is almost complete. We just need to fix one bug and finish the "RollDie()" method.

#### The Challenge

###### Part 1: Complete the RollDie() Method
The RollDie() method should return a random integer between 1 and 6 that represents the roll of the die.
Our application will call this method twice so we need to make sure both dice are random (It probably wouldn't be natural to roll 10 doubles in a row)

###### Part 2: Fix the logic bug
We tell the user to to press enter to roll again but that doesn't seem to work. Guess we need to fix that. 

#### Score some bonus points
Can you figure out how to make the dice look like real dice instead of plain boring old text? (Hint: A lower case o sort of looks like the pip (dot) on the dice)

Wouldn't it be cool if our app made the sound of rolling dice every time it rolled?

How about some extra feedback for the user? 

Maybe a special message or two when a special combination is rolled?
